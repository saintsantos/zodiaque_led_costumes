The code to run the costumes for Zodiaque's audio and motion triggered
costumes. This code is meant to be run on dancer csotumes. The code has
two states. One which handles the animation when the dancer is not moving,
which will make a random pixel in the string of LEDs blink white. The
other is an animation that triggers when the dancer is moving. This will
show LEDs based on the pitch and volume of a sound that the device
registers.
